❖ Answer the following questions:
A) What is a DTD? Provide an example.
Solution:

DTD stands for Document Type Definition
• DTDs specify:
	– the set of tags
	– the order of tags
	- attributes associated with each tag
• DTDs can be seen as a context free grammar
• A well-formed XML document that conforms to its DTD is called valid

<!ELEMENT ARTICLE (HEADLINE,BYLINE,LEAD,BODY,NOTES)>
<!ELEMENT HEADLINE (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT BYLINE (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT LEAD (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT BODY (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT NOTES (#PCDATA)>

B) What is XML Schema? Provide an example.
Solution:-

An XML Schema describes the structure of an XML document, just like a DTD.

An XML document with correct syntax is called "Well Formed".

An XML document validated against an XML Schema is both "Well Formed" and "Valid".

<xs:element name="note">

<xs:complexType>
  <xs:sequence>
    <xs:element name="to" type="xs:string"/>
    <xs:element name="from" type="xs:string"/>
    <xs:element name="heading" type="xs:string"/>
    <xs:element name="body" type="xs:string"/>
  </xs:sequence>
</xs:complexType>

</xs:element>

C) What are Linked Open Data?
Solution:
Linked Open Data defines a vision of globaly globaly accessible and linked data on the internet based on the RDF standards of the semantic web. LOD is often thought of as a virtual data cloud where anyone can access any data they are authorized to see and may also add to any data without disturbing the original data source. This provides an open environment where data can be created, connected and consumed on internet scale. A basic theory of LOD is that data has more value if it can be connected to other data. Data, in this context, is any structured web-based information
